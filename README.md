# Amstrad CPC Easi-amsword to HTML converter made with javascript, html and css

In 80's, early computers consumers use simple and primitive word proccesors like [Easy-amsword](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Easi-Amsword), made in Basic, usually included as a gift when you buy an Amstrad CPC464.

Some users make several docs than only this software can read, so now you need an operative Amstrad CPC or an emulator to read them, there isn't a simple way to convert them to new formats... until now.

I make a simple software to convert these files to simple HTML, so you can edit with a new wordproccesor as [LibreOffice.org](http://libreoffice.org) writer, HTML editors like [BlueGriffon](http://bluegriffon.org/) or any code editor.

This software can use original easi-amsword files or the unofficial fork that manages several special characters or some format as bold, italics, overwrite, etc...

This software is under GNU/GPL 2 license so you can get here the [source code](https://github.com/cpcbegin/easiamsword2html), you can change to fix to your needs.

I hope it is useful for you to recover your documents of that time stored in tapes and you can preserve them for the future.

Notice: this software may be buggy, if you detect a bug comment in [issues section](https://github.com/cpcbegin/easiamsword2html/issues).

If you can't extract your easi-amsword docs from your tapes, look in [CPCWiki Emulation tools section](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Emulators#Emulation_Tools).
